Distributed systems (citation), were always part of computer science, one can even find distributed system within a single computer (citation to time-clocks). Famously even bakery (citation to lamport) can be viewed as distributed system. In this paper we will look into very specific area which helps to tame some of the distributed systems issues.

Program correctness is also part of consideration of early computer science. Famously, again Lamport asserted that algorithm without proof is just a conjunction not a theorem. In this paper we will use Idris2 as tool to increase the accuracy and hopefully to turn so of those conjunctions into theorems.

Software correctness also is not a new thing within the industry, very first computer scientist are mathematician by trade  

Second area that this work look into is a program correctness

gained increased adoption due to various events in the industry.

One of the main driver is an increased adoption of cloud computing, not just by enterprise, but even start-ups start to think about scaling early on.

Emerged new concept of "microservices" (citation), (note here that microservices originates from SOA, some people in the field even argue that microservices is the new name for SOA). Microservices are native to distributed systems, one can think about this as an abstract methodology how to design, maintain and test distributed systems.
